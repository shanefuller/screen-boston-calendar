# Screen Boston Movie Calendar
This python web app scrapes the Screen Boston website daily, creates a calendar, and uploads it to a public Google Calendar. This should allow for others to import the boston movie calendar across several theaters into their own calendars.

The code on how I got it working is here. If you want to try this out yourself, you will need to use your own set of credentials. I included a sample file for my credentials so that you can get an idea of what it is supposed to look like.
