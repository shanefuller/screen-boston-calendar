# Screen Boston Movie Calendar
This python web app scrapes the Screen Boston website daily, creates a calendar, and uploads it to a public Google Calendar. This should allow for others to import the boston movie calendar across several theaters into their own calendars. The script runs with a cron job at 6:30am every morning, and updates the public calendar with any new changes.

The code on how I got it working is here. If you want to try this out yourself, you will need to use your own set of credentials. I included a sample file for my credentials so that you can get an idea of what it is supposed to look like.

Here is the link to add the Google Calendar to your view! Enjoy, and happy movie watching!
